### Stack Research Definition: Middleware for Model Selection in Ollama

#### Objective:
To develop a middleware solution that can programmatically select the most suitable machine learning model from an existing library based on the user's request. This middleware will act as an intermediary between the user and the Ollama API, analyzing the specific task at hand to determine which model would be best suited for the job.

#### Background:
Currently, users are manually selecting models in Ollama through trial and error to find the most appropriate one for a given task. While there is value in having diverse options available—such as some models excelling in code generation while others perform better at text classification—the process can be improved by automating the model selection.

#### Requirements:
1. **Middleware Functionality**:
   - The middleware should sit between the user's request and Ollama API.
   - It needs to parse incoming requests from users.
   - Based on the parsed information, it must determine which model in the library would be most effective for the task at hand.

2. **Model Library Integration**:
   - Middleware should have access to a comprehensive list of available models within Ollama.
   - Each model's capabilities and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, speed) should be cataloged.

3. **Request Analysis**:
   - The middleware must analyze the user’s request to understand the nature of the task.
   - It needs to identify key factors such as whether the task involves code generation or text classification, among others.

4. **Selection Logic**:
   - Develop a set of rules or algorithms that can match the analyzed request with the most appropriate model from the library.
   - The selection logic should be flexible enough to accommodate new models and changing requirements over time.

5. **Integration with Open Router**:
   - Since the user is currently using Open Router for cloud LLMs, the middleware needs to integrate seamlessly with this service.
   - This integration ensures that once a model is selected by the middleware, it can be accessed via Open Router’s API.

#### Expected Outcome:
- A robust and flexible middleware solution capable of automating the selection process for machine learning models in Ollama based on user requests.
- Enhanced efficiency and accuracy in task execution due to optimized model usage.
- Reduced dependency on manual trial-and-error methods, leading to faster development cycles and improved productivity.
